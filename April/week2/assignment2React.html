        <p>ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript 
            library for building reusable UI components. It is an open-source, component-based front end library which is responsible only for the view layer of the application. It was initially developed and maintained by Facebook 
            and later used in its products like WhatsApp & Instagram.
